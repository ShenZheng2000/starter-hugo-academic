**Abstract**

The fishing industry has been a critical and promising research area. Past studies have been unable to relate the fishery economy geographically to agriculture and freshwater resources. This paper presents analytics, regressions on an agriculture-fishery dataset in mainland China, and we provide suggestions based upon our findings. Firstly, we import the dataset and clean missing and extreme values. Secondly, we conduct various exploratory analyses concerning distribution, correlation, geography to explore the characteristics, connections, and discrepancies for different variables. We also run principal component analysis, independent analysis, and multicollinearity analysis to exploit statistical independence information. Thirdly, we build a carefully-tuned random forest regressor for predicting the fishery economy. After that, we verify our model’s accuracy using several benchmarking metrics. Finally, we draw significant conclusions and recommendations for the agriculture-fishery industries in mainland China based on our data analytics and machine learning results.
