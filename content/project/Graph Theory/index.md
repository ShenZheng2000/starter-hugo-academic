**Abstract**

Graph theory is an important research topic in mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. There is an extensive amount of research about graph theory about its theoretical framework and its corresponding applications. However, few studies have attempted to relate graph theory with the consensus algorithm, which reveals the graph's underlying structure and numerical stability using the distributed average. The distributed average scheme is vital because we can conclude how the information from one node will evolve in the transmission process. In this paper, we hope to bring closer graph theory and consensus algorithms. Firstly, we give a brief introduction to graph theory by listing a concise definition. Then we analyze and visualize some commonly used graphs. Secondly, we list an overview of the consensus algorithm, including its structure and significance. We then visualize and analyze how the distributed average scheme will reach consensus node values for different probability distributions. Thirdly, we introduce a centralized algorithm about its organizations and functions. Using nodes with different distributions, we analyze how a centralized algorithm will use those nodes to affect the initialized ones. Fourthly, we bring several root-finding algorithms as a supplement to this paper. Finally, we derive conclusions and list important mathematical deviations and algorithms
