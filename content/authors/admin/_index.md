Welcome! I am Shen Zheng (Lebron). I am currently a computer vision engineer at Momenta, under the mentoring of Mr. Yongjun Yu and [Dr. Wangjiang Zhu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E6%9C%9B%E6%B1%9F-%E6%9C%B1-47946096/?originalSubdomain=cn). Before joining Momenta, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Wenzhou-Kean University](https://wku.edu.cn/en/) with a major in Mathematical Sciences and a minor in Economics. During my undergraduate study, I was lucky to have [Dr. Gaurav Gupta](https://wku.edu.cn/faculty/gaurav-gupta/) as my academic and research supervisor. Apart from my study at Wenzhou-Kean University, I also attended the iSURE research program provided by the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) in 2021 and was fortunate to have [Dr. Chaoli Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/) as my supervisor.

My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, and computer graphics. My paper has been accepted by premier conferences like [CVIP](https://cvip2020.iiita.ac.in/), [IJCNN](https://www.ijcnn.org/), and [WACV](https://wacv2022.thecvf.com/home). I have also served as the reviewer for [CVIP 2021](https://iitrpr.cvip2021.com/) and [AAAI 2022](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-22/). Currently, I am working on self-supervised and unsupervised image restoration and enhancement, object detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. I aim to join a master's program in the USA in 2022.
