Welcome! I am Shen Zheng (Lebron). I am an incoming [MSCV](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-computer-vision/) student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I received my Bachelor's degree from [Wenzhou-Kean University](https://wku.edu.cn/en/) with a major in Mathematical Sciences (magna cum laude) and a minor in Economics. 

During my undergrad, I was lucky to have [Dr. Gaurav Gupta](https://wku.edu.cn/faculty/gaurav-gupta/) as my academic and research supervisor. Apart from studying at Wenzhou-Kean University, I attended the [iSURE](https://ndi-sa.nd.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&id=10096) research program provided by the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) and was fortunate to have [Dr. Chaoli Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/) as my supervisor. I have also worked as a computer vision engineer at [Momenta](https://www.momenta.cn/), mentored by Mr. Yongjun Yu and [Dr. Wangjiang Zhu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E6%9C%9B%E6%B1%9F-%E6%9C%B1-47946096/?originalSubdomain=cn).

My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, computer graphics, medical image analysis, and autonomous driving. My works have been accepted by premier conferences like [WACV](https://wacv2022.thecvf.com/home) and [CVPR](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/). Currently, I am working on zero-shot low-light image enhancement, point cloud classification and segmentation, medical image domain generalization and adaptation, and image generation with GAN and VAE.

I am actively looking for a summer internship position in 2023. If interested, feel free to send me an email (shenzhen@andrew.cmu.edu).
