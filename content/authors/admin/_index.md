Welcome! I am Shen Zheng (Lebron). I am a currently a computer vision engineer at Momenta, under the mentoring of Mr. Yongjun Yu and Dr. Wangjiang Zhu. Before joining Momenta, I received my Bachelor’s degree from Wenzhou-Kean University with a major in Mathematical Sciences and a minor in Economics. During my undergraduate study, I was lucky to have Dr. Gaurav Gupta as my academic and research supervisor. Apart from my study at Wenzhou-Kean University, I also attended the iSURE research program of the University of Notre Dame in 2021 and was fortunate to have Dr. Chaoli Wang as my research supervisor.

My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, and computer graphics. I am currently working on self-supervised and unsupervised image restoration and enhancement, object detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. I aim to join a master's program in USA in 2022.
